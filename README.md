👋 Hi, I’m Honza Slavík 

👀 Currently, I am interested in machine learning in Python using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries. 

🧠 Although I am at the beginning of my career in machine learning, I have a solid foundation in algorithms and data analysis. I would like to apply the knowledge gained in courses and further develop it under the guidance of an expert or mentor. I am ready to learn quickly and apply new technologies and methods that can improve products and services. 

🌱 I have recently completed courses in Python programming, artificial intelligence, and data analysis, and I am currently working in the non-profit sector. 

💡 I am creative and enjoy finding new ways to solve problems. I believe that my fresh perspective can bring new ideas and innovations.
